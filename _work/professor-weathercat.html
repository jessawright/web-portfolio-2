<h3 class="work__heading">Project</h3>
  <p class="work__text">Make a responsive single page app that displays current weather information for a given location and generates a Pusheen illustration based on the weather.</p>

<h3 class="work__heading">Development</h3>
<ul class="work__list">
  <li class="work__list-item">I started with Open&shy;Weather&shy;Map's API for weather information, largely for their easy-to-visualize weather categories.</li>
  <li class="work__list-item">I used the Google Maps Places Autocomplete API to allow users to search for a location. This gives the app a more robust search function than that built into Open&shy;Weather&shy;Map. Once the app has the location from the search (or browser geolocation), it adds the coordinates to the API call to Open&shy;Weather&shy;Map.</li>
  <li class="work__list-item"> I assigned a series of illustration elements to each weather category from OpenWeatherMap and stores these lists in a JSON. For example, "broken clouds" is assigned white clouds, gray clouds, grass, and desaturated sky color. Once the app gets the weather category, it retrieves the image list for that category, then modifies the list based on temperature and time of day (ex. Cold enough for a hat? Night or day?). The app collects and displays illustrations based on this final list.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="work__heading">Design</h3>
  <ul class="work__list">
    <li class="work__list-item">I used Pusheen illustrations, but I still did a fair amount of illustration work. Many elements are only very lightly modified from originals at <a href="http://www.pusheen.com/">Pusheen.com</a>. I modified other illustrations more heavily and made some from scratch in Photoshop.</li>
    <li class="work__list-item">I designed the UI elements displaying the weather information to be sympathetic to Pusheen's style and unobtrusive to the generated illustration. The font, Varela Round, imitates the lettering in original Pusheen illustrations; the transparency of the display boxes balances readability of the text with visibility of the illustration.</li>
  </ul>
