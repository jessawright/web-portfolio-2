<h3 class="work__heading">Development</h3>
<ul class="work__list">
  <li class="work__list-item">To begin, I knew I wanted to make some sort of cohesive storyline with a variety of possible GIFs/intertitles for each frame. I collected interesting and useful intertitles from silent movies, categorized them, and created a storyline based on what I had. From there, I collected silent movie GIFs featuring Harold Lloyd and Mildred Davis, having only two actors to give the movies some continuity.</li>
  <li class="work__list-item">I created a JSON to store my content: several possible GIFs/intertitles for each frame with some metadata. Each silent move begins as a randomly generated series of numbers, one number per frame. Each of those numbers represents which of the possible GIFs/intertitles for that frame will be displayed. By using a series of numbers, users can move forward and backward in the same movie before generating a new one.</li>
  <li class="work__list-item">Each frame has a bit of metadata displayed (source movie title, year, and a link to the GIF source). Using the Twitter API, each frame is also tweetable, with an automatically generated tweet including this metadata.</li>
</ul>
