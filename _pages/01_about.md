I am a self-taught web developer and designer, currently focusing on front-end and UI development.

I have an education in studio art and handcraft, giving me an eye for design. I have experience in library work, giving me skill in organizing information conceptually and visually.

Though I am new to programming, I have a natural knack for the logical. I find programming to be delightful, even when it is also frustrating. As my newest skill, this is where I will grow the fastest in upcoming months and years and I am excited for the challenge. I am having a blast learning this!

My toolset includes:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* React
* APIs
* SVG
* Webpack
* Git/GitHub
* Adobe Photoshop
* Adobe Illustrator
* Inkscape
