I am a self-taught web developer, currently focusing on front-end and UI development.

My education in studio art and handcraft gives me an eye for design. I try to avoid making arbitrary design decisions, looking to the content and intended audience for design cues.

From my library work, I have professional experience organizing information both visually and in databases (library catalogs), catering to the needs of my audience. Likewise, I organize website content according to the intended audience as well as organizing my own workflow.

My thinking style tends toward the strictly logical, which makes learning programming smooth and fun. Since I am very new to the field, it is my raw programming skill that will grow the fastest as I learn the capabilities and syntax of a given language.

How do you feel about CSS? Many developers seem to hate it, but I enjoy it as a logical puzzle, just as I do the programming. 

My toolset includes:

* CSS3
* HTML5
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* React
* Bootstrap
* APIs
* SVG
* Adobe Photoshop
* Adobe Illustrator
* Git/GitHub
